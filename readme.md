# Using claude sonnnet

Asked claude sonnet to create a mortgage loan calculator app using react for the front end with a rust backend.

```bash 
npx create-react-app loan-calculator-frontend
cd loan-calculator-frontend
```


```bash
cargo new loan-calculator-backend
cd loan-calculator-backend
```

After modifying the src as per Claude run both

In backend directory

```bash
cargo run
```

In frontend directory

```bash
npm start
```

## Asked about serverless deployment

Suggested several options: AWS Lambda, Google cloud functions + Firebase, Azure fucntions 
* In all cases, the rust code has to be modified to use the platform's crates (e.g. `lambda-http` instead of `actix-web`).
    * also the build process is changed, e.g. this for AWS  `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
    * handling API gateways as per the platform
* The react code is to be built `npn run build`, and then the contents of `build` directory uploaded to static service such as s3, Firebase (google), etc.

The following is verbatim:

Certainly! There are several options to run your loan calculator app in a serverless cloud platform. Here are some popular choices, along with brief explanations of how you could adapt your app for each:

1. AWS Lambda + API Gateway (for Rust backend) + S3 (for React frontend)
* Backend:
    * Package your Rust code as a Lambda function
    * Use AWS API Gateway to create HTTP endpoints
    * Replace Actix-web with the lambda_http crate

* Frontend:
   * Build your React app
   * Upload the static files to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting


2. Google Cloud Functions (for Rust backend) + Firebase Hosting (for React frontend)
* Backend:
  * Package your Rust code as a Cloud Function
  * Use the cloud_functions crate to handle HTTP requests
* Frontend:
  * Build your React app
  * Deploy to Firebase Hosting

3. Azure Functions (for Rust backend) + Azure Static Web Apps (for React frontend)
4. Cloudflare Workers (for both backend and frontend)
* Backend:
  * Rewrite your Rust code to work with Cloudflare Workers using the worker crate
* Frontend:
  * Build your React app
  * Deploy the static assets to Cloudflare Pages or Workers Sites

5. Vercel .. but no rust! Use node or something else that is supported
